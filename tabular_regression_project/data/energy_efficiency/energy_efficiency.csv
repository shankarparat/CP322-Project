# Placeholder CSV file for energy efficiency data
# This file should contain the energy efficiency dataset
# Common columns: Relative_Compactness, Surface_Area, Wall_Area, Roof_Area,
# Overall_Height, Orientation, Glazing_Area, Glazing_Area_Distribution,
# Heating_Load, Cooling_Load
# 
# To use this project:
# 1. Replace this file with actual energy efficiency data
# 2. Ensure target columns are clearly identified
# 3. Update preprocessing scripts for correct target selection

# Example structure:
# Relative_Compactness,Surface_Area,Wall_Area,Roof_Area,Overall_Height,Orientation,Glazing_Area,Glazing_Area_Distribution,Heating_Load,Cooling_Load
